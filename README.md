Adopty is a üê∂ dog adoption sample application built to demonstrate Jetpack Compose Ui


## :bulb: Motivation and Context
<!--- Optionally point readers to interesting parts of your submission. -->
<!--- What are you especially proud of? -->
I took the #AndroidDevChallenge as a reason to learn Jetpack Compose for building a real world application. So I decided not to use any fake data in the Adopty app.
Adopty app uses the [Petfinders api] (https://www.petfinder.com/developers/v2/docs/) as a data source to show the lists of pets in the application.
