Adopty is a üê∂ dog adoption sample application built to demonstrate Jetpack Compose Ui. Adopty app uses modern android development tools, design principles and best practices.

## Features
Adopty simply loads data form from the api and shows it in Jetpack compose `LazyList` composable. Adopty app uses the [Petfinders api](https://www.petfinder.com/developers/v2/docs/) as a data source to show the lists of pets in the application./

- It also demonstrates the use of android 12 [SplashScreen](https://developer.android.com/about/versions/12/features/splash-screen) api, including loading data in the background while the SplashScreen is shown on the screen.
- Demonstrates how to implement animations while navigation between screens in Jetpack compose applications using the [accompanist-navigation-animation](https://google.github.io/accompanist/navigation-animation/) library.

## Code Formating ‚úÖ
This project uses [Spotless gragle plugin](https://github.com/diffplug/spotless/tree/main/plugin-gradle). Internally spotless uses [ktlint](https://github.com/pinterest/ktlint) to properly format the code. Always use `gradlew app:spotlessApply` before commiting your code.
